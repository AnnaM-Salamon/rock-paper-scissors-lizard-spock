### Features Left to Implement

I want to add a timer to allow users to play against the clock. Timer with the ability to select the time length in seconds and minutes. Such a feature would allow the players to decide the length of the session. For instance, adapting the decision to the user's own needs (time constraints).
The game will become more attractive and the participants motivation will increase as they want to win before the allotted time expires.
