# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock



Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an advanced version of the classic Rock Pape Scissors game that adds more complexity and excitement to the gameplay.
 The game was popularised by the tv show The Big Bang Theory. In this version, the two extra options – Lizard and Spock – were added to create more possible outcomes and increase the challenge and unpredictability of the game.

Unpredictability makes the game fun and challenging. 

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an engaging game with simple-to-follow rules that will help the users break away from everyday life just for a moment.
The site is targeted towards everyone: adults and children and it guarantees good fun.

- __The Game Area__


The Game Area is divided into sections 

+ Possible Choices - here, the user has five options to chose by simply clicking on an icon of a hand gesture representing: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock.

+ Results - The game has three possible results: "You win!", "Computer wins! " or "It's a tie", based on the player's choice competing against a chance outcome generated by a computer. 

+ Score - this feature counts one point (1) for every win and it is a numerical presentation of the game results.

+ The Choices  made by Player and Computer - the name from Player Input is passed to the content  of this element denoting choices made by the player and  a computer.

### Features Left to Implement


I want to add a timer to allow users to play against the clock. Timer with the ability to select the time length in seconds and minutes. Such a feature would allow the players to decide the length of the session. For instance, adapting the decision to the user's own needs (time constraints).
The game will become more attractive and the participants motivation will increase as they want to win before the allotted time expires.



## Testing 


- Tetsed and played on diffrent devices and browsers (Chrome, Safari and Firefox).
- After testing via Lighthouse on Chrome Dev tools the Performace came out low.

I decided to search for ways to - eliminate render blocking resources. I tried few options . I understood that the added to  the <head> of this file, CSS link  to Font Awesome could cause the problem. I tried to download directory locally or link js Font Awesome kit but this did not help  to improve the site performance.

I used then another method which was  to apply the defer  attribute of the <script> tag and adding it to the body section of the HTML.
